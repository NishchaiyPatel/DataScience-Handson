Adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data is the following. Data is a single dataframe, containing at least a location of the caf\u00e9. **Explanation** of the location data is a standard tuple `(lat, lng)`, where `lat` stands for latitude and `lng` for longitude. Some other metadata like name, postal code and so on is also collected, but let us **discuss** that they are not absolutely necessary for the analysis. **Example** of the data:\n\n<img src=\"Ahm.jpg\"></img>\n\n**Data will be used** in the following way: by knowing the locations of already existing cafes, it's possible to apply unsupervised learning technique like kernel density estimation (KDE) to determine the area of influence of the existing cafes, and start up new caf\u00e9 which is not in the area of influence.\n\n"
