If someone is looking to open a caf\u00e9 restaurant, **the question is**, where would you recommend that they open it? **The background of the problem** is that in order for a caf\u00e9 to be profitable, there must be enough customers, and in order to have enough customers, it is not worth setting up a caf\u00e9 in the immediate promixity of existing ones.\n\nLet's also make sure that **audience is explicitly defined** to be the local restaurant entrepreuners in Ahmedabad and **they should care about this problem** because the location of the new caf\u00e9 has a significant impact on the expected returns."
